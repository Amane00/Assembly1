######## Name
li a0, 4 #li stands for Load immediate
#a0: Function arguments / Return values
#a0 used to pass arguments to system call
#the immediate value 4 into register a0
#4 means next operation is print a string
la a1, msg1 #la stand for load absolute address
#a1: Function arguments / Return values
#the address of the string msg1 into register a1
ecall #call a system call (4: write system call)
#Execute a write system call to out put the msg1
#ex) li a0, 4 
#The OS write system call corresponding to system call number 4 is called
li a0, 8 #similar code with line 37, but system call num is different
#8: system call for reading strings
la a1, name #Loads the address defined by the name label into the a1 register
li a2, 64 #let the  maximum size of string to read as 64 bytes
#a2:Function arguments
ecall#Execute a write system call to out put the msg1
#ex) li a0, 4 
#The OS write system call corresponding to system call number 4 is called
li a0, 4 #same code with line 37 so we need to call write system call again to print msg2
la a1, msg2 #the address of the string msg2 into register a1
ecall
li a0, 4 #write system call 
# works like cout in c++(?)
la a1, name

######## Student ID
# almost same code what i used in above(name) 
#print msg3

#  sum = sum * i;

#t3==n, if n is a negative integer jump to exit
#differences with j exit is j doesn't check condition
# here i need the condition that n is negative
li t1, 1 # load 1 into register t1
# initialization that t1=sum=1

#if t2 ==0, then jump to printresult
mul t1, t1, t2 # mul;Multiply
# t1 = ti*t2 (sum = sum*i)
addi t2, t2, -1 #Add Immediate 
#t2 = t2-i (i=i-1)
# i represents n, but i(t2) is subtracted 1 in each loop
#so that why copied t3 to t2 in line 114
